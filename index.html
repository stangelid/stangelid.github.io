<p>I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher with several years of experience building novel Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, and Recommender Systems solutions in both academic and industrial settings. My core expertise lies in applying deep learning to complex ranking tasks with little or no supervision.</p>

<p>Beyond my technical career, I am a dedicated animal welfare advocate, continuously gaining hands-on experience in animal protection and rescue. I am currently taking a gap year to focus on volunteer work, primarily helping to improve the lives of community cats in Greece through humane trap-neuter-return (TNR), rescue, and community fundraising efforts (<a href="https://www.ninelivesgreece.com/why-spay-neuter/">learn more about TNR and the cat overpopulation crisis</a>).</p>
    
Before that, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer and Team Lead at <a target="_blank" href="https://deeplab.ai/">Deeplab</a>, building state-of-the-art recommender systems that help personalise the online experience for millions of users every day.</p>

<p>I served as a PhD student and, subsequently, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <a target="_blank" href="https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/">EdinburghNLP group</a> (part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc">Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/">School of Informatics</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>). During my time there (2014-2021), I was fortunate to be advised by and collaborate with Prof. <a target="_blank" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/">Mirella Lapata</a>. The main focus of our research work was to develop novel deep learning methodologies for understanding and summarizing long-form text, with a particular interest in summarizing popular user opinions found in online reviews. I have also collaborated with brilliant researchers and engineers from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.megagon.ai/">Megagon Labs</a> and Amazon CoreML (Barcelona).</p>

<!--<p>One of the main objectives of my ongoing research is to develop unsupervised or weakly supervised methodologies for discovering and summarizing popular opinions found in user-generated text.</p>-->

<p>I succesfully completed my PhD in April 2019, under the supervision of Prof. Mirella Latapa and Prof. Charles Sutton (Thesis: <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/36006" target="_blank"><i>"Weakly Supervised Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Extraction"</i></a>). Before my PhD, I obtained a MSc in Artificial Intelligence with distinction from the University of Edinburgh and a BSc in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.uoa.gr/eng">Informatics and Telecommunucations</a> from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.uoa.gr/">National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</a>.</p>
